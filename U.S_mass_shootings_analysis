1. Describe your dataset. Give the source and a metadata listing for each variable. In other words,
list the names of the variables, types, and brief descriptions of values if needed. This answer is just
text (in a list format) – no code needed.

The dataset is a compilation of every mass shooting ever recorded. It's also important to know what a "mass shooting" is defined as. According to the FBI, a mass shooting is an event where 4 or more people are victims of a shooting. A variable listed is Gender (factor), which tells if the shooter was a male or a female. Another variable is race (factor), which tells the face of the shooter. Another variable is location (factor), which tells the location of the shooter by city and state. Another variable is the date (factor), which tells when the shooting occured. Another variable is fatalities (integer), which counts how many people were killed during the shooting. A similar variable is wounded (integer), which counts the number of people wounded, but not killed, during the shooting. Another similar variable is the total victims (integer), which counts the total number of victims of the shooting. Another variable is location type (factor), which tells the type of location such as schools, religious places, mililitary, etc. Another variable is prior signs of mental illness (factor), which tells us if the shooter had signs of mental illness before the shooting. Another varible is weapons obtained legally (factor), which tells us if the shooter obtained a gun legally or not. Another variable is where weapon obtain (factor), describes where the gun was purchased. Another variable was type of weapon (factor), it tells what weapons were used during the shooting such as handgun, rifle, shotgun, etc.  

2. Give three questions about your dataset that you are going to investigate. Your questions should
address both variation and covariation. This answer is just text – no code needed. 

a. What type of gun is used most in mass shootings? 

b. Is there a corelation between the type of gun used and the total number of victims/fatalities?

c. Were the majority of guns obtained illegally or legally and where did they obtain them? 

3. Perform EDA to answer your research questions. Your EDA should:
• Use dplyr()
• Use ggplot2 to visualize the data. Visualizations should be compelling/interesting and include
labels, appropriate color, axes limits, etc.
• Use at least two of the following depending on your questions of interest: geom_histogram,
geom_bar, geom_boxplot, geom_point, geom_tile
• Map the variables to aesthetics appropriately (coordinates, color, shape, size )
• Include appropriate visualizations depending on variable type (quantitative or categorical) and
research question asked. Make sure visualizations show the answer to your research questions.
• A research question may need more than one dplyr command and/or one visualization to
answer it. For example, if a research question leads to another related question, you will need
more than one dplyr command/visualization to answer the original and related question.

4. Write a two paragraph summary about what your EDA is telling you about your data. This answer
is just text – no code 

I first asked my self the question "What type of gun is used most in mass shootings?" Once I started to look into the data the answer was pretty clear. Hands down, the most common weapon used in mass shootings were handguns, accounting for about 52% of mass shootings. That 52% doesn't even account for the number of shootings in which handguns were used along side with other guns. But Rifles alone only account for about 7% of mass shootings. When used along side other weapons rifles account for about 19% of mass shootings. The second question I asked myself was is there a corelation between the type of gun used and the total number of victims/fatalities? After digging into that I found out that there is no correlation between the type of weapons used in a shooting and the number of victims. The real relationshop is number of guns and the number of victims. It seems that if the shooter used more/different types of guns more people were hurt/killed. 

The last thing I asked myself was were the majority of guns obtained illegally or legally and where did they obtain them? Believe it or not, most of the weapons were obtained legally (79%). But when I looked at where the guns were obtained, the data showed that there were 17(24%) shootings where they didn't know where the guns came from. The majority of the guns came from gunshops and sporting goods stores, which accounted for about 41%. Or the guns were stolen, which accounted for about 13%.
